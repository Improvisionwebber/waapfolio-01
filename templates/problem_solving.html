        THE PROBLEM
    </h3>
    <p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-up">
        The major problem that WAAPFOLIO is solving is the fact that mobile users who are mostly not familiar with tech—e.g., WhatsApp vendors, market men, small business owners, and even teens who want to start a business but don't have the money—can now easily create a store on WAAPFOLIO. They can list products directly to WhatsApp, enabling buyers and sellers to have a very “wow” performance.
